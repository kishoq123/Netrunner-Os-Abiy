## 1. Installation of Netrunner OS

Installing Netrunner OS is a straightforward process. This section provides a comprehensive guide to help you through each step, ensuring a smooth installation experience.

### System Requirements

Before starting, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Processor**: 64-bit processor
- **RAM**: Minimum 2 GB (4 GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: At least 20 GB of free space
- **Graphics**: A graphics card that supports 3D acceleration

### Preparing Your System

1. **Backup Important Data**: Always back up your important files before starting the installation.
2. **Create Bootable Media**:
   - Download the Netrunner OS ISO file from the [Releases](https://github.com/kishoq123/Netrunner-Os-Abiy/releases) section.
   - Use tools like Rufus (Windows) or Etcher (Linux/macOS) to create a bootable USB drive.

### BIOS Setup

1. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup (usually by pressing F2, F10, or DEL).
2. Change the boot order to prioritize USB devices.
3. Save changes and exit.

### Graphical Installation Process

1. Boot from the USB drive. You will see the Netrunner OS welcome screen.
2. Select "Install Netrunner OS."
3. Follow the prompts to select your language, keyboard layout, and installation type (e.g., erase disk or dual-boot).
4. Set up your user account and password.
5. Review your choices and click "Install."
6. Once the installation completes, restart your computer and remove the USB drive.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Netrunner OS.

## 2. Understanding the wait() System Call

The `wait()` system call is a crucial part of process management in Unix-like operating systems, including Netrunner OS. This section will explain its syntax, usage, and significance in preventing zombie processes.

### What is the wait() System Call?

The `wait()` system call allows a process to wait for its child processes to terminate. This helps maintain proper process synchronization and resource management.

### Syntax

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

pid_t wait(int *status);
```

### Parameters

- **status**: A pointer to an integer where the exit status of the terminated child process is stored.

### Return Value

- On success, `wait()` returns the process ID of the terminated child.
- On failure, it returns -1.

### Real-World Use Cases

1. **Process Synchronization**: When a parent process creates a child process, it can use `wait()` to ensure that it completes its task before proceeding.
2. **Resource Management**: Using `wait()` helps prevent zombie processes, which occur when a child process has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table.

### Example in C

Here‚Äôs a simple example demonstrating the use of `wait()` in a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process is running.\n");
        exit(0);
    } else {
        // Parent process
        int status;
        wait(&status);
        printf("Child process terminated with status: %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Preventing Zombie Processes

To avoid zombie processes, always use `wait()` after creating a child process. This ensures that the operating system cleans up resources associated with the terminated child.
